***An age-old Classic with a simple Twist! Local-Multiplayer for 2 snakes in one arena in your very familiar snake game!***


-All the core GamePlay functionality of a classic snake game have been implemented, namely :
- Snake gains points and size by eating good food
- Snake Dies on biting self
- Snake Dies if bitten by another snake
-Adding on, A screen wrapping for all the directions much like the Original arcade/atari variations of the game was also implemented
-Both a Single and a Local-Multiplayer Game Mode are available!
-Implemented a Mass Gaining(Increases point and size by 1) and Mass Burning(Decreases point and size by 1) food that appears at random times and random points in the game
-There are also, 3 PowerUps for an additional bit of fun :)
-A Speed Boost powerup temporarily boosts the movement speed of the snake eating it
-A Shield powerup temporarily makes the snake in question unable to die, even from being bitten or eating Mass Burner Food
-A 2X point booster powerup temporarily doubles the amount of points gained on eating mass Gaining food

-Fun Lil tidbit, I also tried experimenting with writing music and SFX for the game so all those within the game are created by me using :
1. Bosca Ceoil for the Game Music and Active PowerUp SFX
2. DrPetter's SFXr tool made for the LudumDare Game Jam used for all the other in-Game SFX


Go Ham!
